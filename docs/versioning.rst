Versioning and compatibility
==========================================

This library follows Semantic Versioning, as defined in
https://semver.org/

::

    Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

    MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
    MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
    PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
